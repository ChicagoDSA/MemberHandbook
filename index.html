        <h3>THANK YOU FOR JOINING CHICAGO DSA!</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">The Democratic Socialists of America is the fastest growing socialist organization in the United States today. We woudln't be able to say that without new members like you joining us. And so we'd like to thank you for joining our organization as we work towards building a socialistier America.</p>
      <a name="why"></a>
      <h3>WHAT DOES CDSA DO?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">The Chicago Democratic Socialists of America's mission is to establish democratic socialism as a political force in the United States and around the world by training and mobilizing socialist activists to participate in a vibrant and diverse socialist organization at both the local and the national level. DSA both educates the public about democratic socialist values and policies and builds progressive coalitions to win victories that move the U.S. and the world toward social democracy. In the near term, democratic socialists struggle for reforms that shift power and resources away from corporate elites and put them in the hands of ordinary citizens. In the long term, democratic socialists fight for a world in which all people share equally in the governing of the economic, political and cultural institutions and relationships that shape their lives. </p>

Our current Working Groups include Anti-Racism, Communications, Electoral, Environmental Justice, Health Care, Housing, Labor, Public Education, Rapid Response, Service Assistance Initiative, Socialist Feminist, Solidarity Economy, as well as several reading groups and caucuses.  New Working Groups are also forming — there’s sure to be something that will let you get involved with the DSA in a way that speaks to your motivations.</p>
